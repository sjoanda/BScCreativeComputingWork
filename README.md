# BScCreativeComputingWork
Work from my BSc Creative Computing degree.  Not all work.  Processing sketches may need size(x,y) typing due to program change to not accept variables for screen sizes

This sketch paints a control panel up on the screen and allows the user to move the camera to view 3D shapes
